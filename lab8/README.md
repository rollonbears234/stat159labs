#### Lab 8 to make a simple app using the Shiny Library
- we will use advertising data to create three drop downs


Your ShinyDoc will have a dropdown with a list of 3 options - TV, Radio and newspaper as an input element.
Your output will be a scatter plot between sales and the input option chosen from the dropdown.
You will write your code in a file called app.R
